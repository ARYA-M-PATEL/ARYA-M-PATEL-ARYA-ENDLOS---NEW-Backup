				***** Question for Preparation *****
	Types of tag :1-Paired and Unpaired Tags 

[Paired Tags--
An HTML tag is known as a paired tag when the tag consists of an opening tag and a closing tag as its companion tag. An HTML Paired tag starts with an opening tag: the tag name enclosed inside the angle brackets; for example, a paragraph opening tag is written as ‘<p>’. The content follows the opening tag, which ends with an ending tag: the tag name starting with a forward slash; for example, an ending paragraph tag is written as ‘</p>’. The first tag can be referred to as the ‘Opening Tag’, and the second tag can be called Closing Tag.]

[Unpaired Tags--
An HTML tag is called an unpaired tag when the tag only has an opening tag and does not have a closing tag or a companion tag. The Unpaired HTML tag does not require a closing tag; an opening tag is sufficient in this type. Unpaired tags are sometimes also named as Standalone Tags or Singular Tags since they do not require a companion tag.]
